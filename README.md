## Description

- Our team was asked to develop a warehouse mapping dashboard which is used to display critical information and data related to warehouse utilisation, inventory and logistics management in a graphical representation. The dashboard's highly comprehendible format allows warehouse managers, supervisors, and other stakeholders to make conclusions and decisions immediately.
- Regarding the context of this project, four main warehouse facilities needed to be visualised at Intel, namely Racking Systems, Staging, Drawer, and Freezer. These are storage facilities that Intel uses to store and manage assembly materials. Each facility should have its designated page to view the design and essential analysed metrics in detail. The utilisation metrics are calculated by formulas.
- There are some additional functions of the dashboard:
  - The dashboard should also implement authentication and role-based authorisation features to prevent any unwanted visitors.
  - Only users with Admin and Editor account can upload Excel files to generate data dashboard.
  - User with admin account privilege can make configuration for how utilization of different facilities is calculated.
- For this project, the our team decided to use tools and services:
  - Figma for user-interface design and idea prototype.
  - A framework called NextJs/Vercel for frontend development.
  - A backend as a service platform called Firebase.
  - Notion for project management.
  - Github as a	collaboration platform for managing project source code.
  - Microsoft Teams for hosting online meetings with industry partners and academic supervisor.

## Result analyses & discussions

Reflecting on the journey of developing the Warehouse Mapping Dashboard, spanning the Planning, Design, Development, and Testing phases, it becomes evident that this journey has been a challenging yet profoundly rewarding experience.
- Feedback from industry partners: they was very pleased with the results as well as regarded highly how professional the team’s work methodology was. They found the dashboard’s user interface intuitive, helpful and engaging. The visualisations of all facilities represented the actual ones closely, making their metrics easy to interpret. She also shared the dashboard with other team members, whose feedback was positive as well.
- Testing from team: we had a testing process in place as well as performed User Acceptance Testing with the client, we identified several issues that had not been discovered during development. And out team has fixed minor bugs and ensure the quality of the dashboard.
